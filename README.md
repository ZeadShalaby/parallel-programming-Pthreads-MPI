MPI :The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is an Application Program Interface that defines a model of parallel computing where each parallel process has its own local memory, and data must be explicitly shared by passing messages between processes.

PTHREADS :In computing, POSIX Threads, commonly known as pthreads, is an execution model that exists independently from a programming language, as well as a parallel execution model. It allows a program to control multiple different flows of work that overlap in time.
